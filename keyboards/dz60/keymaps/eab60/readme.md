# eab60

This is my personal 60% layout from when I first started building keyboards.
It has grown a bit over time but is more or less the same.

[![eab60 layout](https://i.imgur.com/PbkfkuJ.png)][layout]

To keep things simple, there are only two layers for typing (and a third for
backlight stuff).  The base layer is mostly standard for 60% keyboards, with a
couple changes.

 * Space cadet shifts (parentheses on tap).
 * `L_GUI` where caps lock normally is.
 * Layer 1 modifier where `L_GUI` normally is.

I use `L_GUI` for my tiling wm modifier key so having it in a relatively handy
place is useful.  Try a tiling wm, [change your life][i3].

Layer 1 gives you a navigation cluster for both your left and right hands and
the rest of the buttons missing from a 104 key keyboard.  There are also
multimedia functions and basic backlighting contols.

More robust backlighting control is achieved by holding down the "menu" key.
These functions aren't documented on the layout image.

 * `ESC` - Toggle backlighting
 * `1`-`9` - Choose preset backlight pattern
 * `-`/`=` - Cycle backward/forward through backlight patterns
 * `q`/`a` - Increase/decrease backlight hue
 * `w`/`s` - Increase/decrease backlight saturation
 * `r`/`f` - Increase/decrease the brightness
